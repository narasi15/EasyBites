Commands:

have node.js installed

OR
run: npm run dev 

it’ll run on localhost:8000

now to run on a server that everyone can access over the internet by typing in url:
- download ngrok for Mac on ngrok.com/download
- on this computer the ngrok files are downloaded in a folder called “ngrok folder”
-  Open one terminal, and cd into the assignment-3-redrum folder
- run: node server.js
- open another terminal and cd to the ngrokfolder
- run: ./ngrok http 8000
- since 8000 is the port number we chose to run on
- ngrok will turn terminal black and will give a url to visit that starts with http
