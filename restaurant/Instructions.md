Regarding:  Submission Deadline Extension.

We are submitting out project on a later date than the deadline.  We’ve been in regular communication with Professor Reid keeping her updated with our progress and going to office hours and a TA for help.
The back-end communication from client to server to restaurant has been quite a challenge but we’ve managed to get it working.  Please find below an email communication with Professor Reid granting us a deadline extension until Tuesday evening.

Sincerely,

Priyanka and Thanin
Redrum Team


Contact with Prof Reid:

Thanin, 

I’d be happy to give you an extension.  If it is helpful and your presentation slot is on Wednesday, I can give you an extension until Tuesday evening.

Regards,
Karen Reid

Hi Karen,
Both my partner and I have had our noses to the grindstone trying to get our assignment up working but we're only two since our other partner dropped the course.  Could we get a 24 hour extension to get something reasonable to present? It feels like we done a lot but the work doesn't seem to have an end.
Sincerely,
Thanin
